The rocket stand is split into 5 major components:

Three arms, One centre piece and a launch rail.

The arms and centre piece should be 3D printed, whilst the launch rail is designed to be a 1m x 2.5mm aluminium rod.

To assemble:
1. Slide the arms onto the central pieces jigsaw joints. 
2. Push the entire module into the ground with your foot by the central piece.
3. Slide the launch rail into the central piece as far as it can go.

It is now complete!
